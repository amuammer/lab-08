## Overview
In this application we are building an app that depends on APIs. In other words our application acts as an intermediary between APIs. We are receiving request from CodeFlows API then we call multi APIs to get location, weather, hicking, movie and restruants information.

## Getting Started
to get started you have to follow the next instructions
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
-> if you are developer
```bash
npm run dev # run with node_mon
```
## Architecture
To run this application, we used NodeJs as a programming language. We used Heroku to deploy the application. Also we used a set of npm libaries such as express, pg, dotenv, superagent.
